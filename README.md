# Twitter-Search-API-Python
A python implementation of the Twitter Search Example.

The master branch has now been merged with the python3 branch.

For those who still need the python2 implementation, there is now a python2 branch with the code on it.

This Python script is an implementation of it's Java version https://github.com/tomkdickinson/TwitterSearchAPI.

It's suitable as an example of how you can extract Tweets from Twitter, without going through their API and obtaining
theoretically much large datasets.

While written for the Java version, the associated blog post for pagination on Twitter can be found
